# This is my portfolio webpage project.
The preview is [here]("https://www.dominikjaworski.pl/")

I am trying to recreate VSCODE look, and store projects as "files"

# Used technologies so far:
- Typescript
- React
- Redux
- Next
- Sass

In this project I try my best to follow <b>KISS & DRY & YAGNI</b> rules

## Starting:

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
